However, I can provide you with a generic code template that you can follow in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on any given dataset.\n\nCode for EDA: \n\n1. Import necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn\n\n2. Load the dataset using pandas `read_csv()` method.\n\n3. Check the shape of the dataset using the `shape` attribute.\n\n4. Check the statistics of the numerical columns using `describe()` method.\n\n5. Check for missing values using `isnull().sum()` method.\n\n6. Check for the correlation between the features using `corr()` method.\n\n7. Visualize the distribution of the target variable.\n\n8. Visualize the relationship between the independent variables and the target variable using scatterplots or boxplots.\n\n9. Visualize the distribution of the independent variables using histograms, density plots or kernel density plots.\n\n10. Use other visualization techniques like heatmaps, pair plots, violin plots or swarm plots to gain insights about the dataset.\n\nRemember, EDA is an iterative process, so it's important to keep exploring and visualizing the data until meaningful insights are found.", "outputs": []}]}
